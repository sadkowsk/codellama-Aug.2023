## 1. Overview
tl;dr: 

What to look for in this presentation (discussion Q&A)
1. Q1
2. Q2

### 1-a. Context
Code generation is a common application of large language models (LLMs), and code-specialized models like Codex and AlphaCode show better code performance than general LLMs like GPT-3. However, the capabilities of these code-specialized models are impacted by their limited context sizes and lack of infilling.

### 1-b. Question
Can an open, general LLM be specialized for code while adding new abilities like long context and infilling?

### 1-c. Approach
* Fine-tune Llama 2 foundation model on code data
* Add infilling objective for 7B and 13B models
* Long context fine-tuning to handle 100k tokens
* Release Code Llama base and Python/Instruct variants
* (What's the "most important part of the paper?")

"Figure 2: The Code Llama specialization pipeline. The different stages of fine-tuning annotated with the number of tokens seen during training. Infilling-capable models are marked with the â‡„ symbol." (Code Llama, p.3)
